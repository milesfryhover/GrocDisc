# Grocery List Discord Bot

## Overview

The Grocery List Discord Bot is a simple yet efficient bot designed to manage a grocery list through a Discord server. It uses Discord's bot API to interact in real-time and allows users to add items, list the current grocery items, remove specific items, or clear the entire list.

I wrote this bot specifically for use with my partner, so I've sprinkled a few cute messages here and there for them to find. :)
